Dreamsoft ProgressBar
---------------------
Dreamsoft ProgressBar is an ideal alternative to other progress
meters when the total duration of an operation is unknown (just
like the one in Windows Explorer "Search" Pane or "Setting 
Folder permissions..." dialog). Supports WindowsXP skins.

As this component is freeware it comes with no warranty of any kind.
However, if your computer does blow up as a direct result of using
it I'd enjoy hearing about the experience.

To use Dreamsoft ProgressBar just drop it onto a form and set a
few properties! The key properties are:

  Speed: Integer   - Set the animation interval (if 0, animation stops)
  Animate: Boolean - Starts or stops the animation

Hope you like it and find it useful. Comments and suggestions are
most welcome. Future revisions of this component will be posted
to http://www.torry.net

Developed and tested with Delphi 3 on Windows XP. It might also
works fine with Delphi 4/5/6/7 on Windows 2000. If it works under 
Windows 98/98SE/Me, please be kind and send me an e-mail:
